\section{Introduction}

In recent years, chatbots have become increasingly popular in a variety of applications, as such, so has the technology surrounding them. It is not our mission to compete with the likes of \cite{openai}, \cite{microsoft} and \cite{github} and their hugely successful LLMs, \cite{gpt4} and \cite{copilot} respectively. At the end of the day, any coursework is a learning experience.

Our solution is a small clientside chatbot, integrated into an intuative graphical user interface and designed to handle prompts around a bespoke context. We utilise modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques, with a knowledge base and infernece engine, conjuncting machine learning and webscraping, in the name of enabeling the user with concurrent information to make informed descicions on their travel plans.

\subsection{Background and Motivation}
% A bit background information on chatbot in general and the coursework specification\citep{AI2018CW}.

As specified in the assignment brief \cite{AI2018CW}, tasks one and two are to implement an intelligent conversational system designed "\textit{to help their customers in finding the cheapest available ticket for their chosen journey}" and "\textit{to improve customer service satisfaction by applying some appropriate AI techniques}" respectively. Following course content and implicit suggestions from the modules authorative figures, our second task implements a delay prediction model, based on historical data (also provided in the course material), in the form of KNN regressor (\cite{knn}), embedded within the original chatbot system created in task one.



\subsection{Aim and Objective} 
% You may rephrase the the aim and objectives from your point of view.  

\subsection{Difficulties and Risks}

% List as many as you can identify. 

\subsection{Work Plan}

% Draw a Gantt Chart and put it here.

\section{Related Work}
% Review some similar chatbot systems. (Write as much as you have now.)  

\section{Methods, Tools and Frameworks}
% In this section, you should describe the methods, programming languages, packages, tools and framework you plan to use.
% for this report, you can list some you have identified and intend to use.
% No need to give any details.     

\subsection{Methods}

% You may list some methods you will use for developing your chatbot, including 
   
% Such as what type of user interface (graphical, text, or voice, etc) you intend to use.

% What Natural Language Processing and understanding methods you intend use, 

% What referring or reasoning methods

% What prediction methods, such as kNN, neural networks etc. 
             
\subsection{Languages, Packages, Tools}

% On programming language: using Python or Java, or others. 

% Packages: for NLP, use NLTK\citep{NLTK}, or others, 

% For KnowledgeBase and Engine: PyKE or PyKnow, or others. 

% For Database: e.g, Postgres, or MongoDB

\section{Design of the Chatbot}

 
\subsection{The Architecture of the chatbot}
% You may draw a functional diagram if you like.  

% You can describe your design for each key module or component of your chatbot, in a subsection. E.g. 
\subsection{User Interface} 

% conversion of input natural language, to processable tokens
\subsection{NLP}

% manipulation of historical tokenized data
\subsection{Knowledgebase}

% 
\subsection{Inferring Engine}

% knn, K nearest neighbour, regressor, aligns to best fit
\subsection{Delay Prediction Models}

\subsection{Conversation Control}
